Imac:
	SYMPTOM
		I installed R and Rstudio and then gitk stopped working
	PROBLEM
		One of them installed the latest version of wish (TCL/tk)
	SOLUTION
		$ which -a wish
		/usr/local/bin/wish
		/usr/bin/wish
		mv /usr/local/bin/wish /usr/local/bin/wish.bak
	RESULT
		now I can run gitk no problem.

Zsh
	SITUATION
		I installed zsh, oh-my-zsh and powerline fonts
	PROBLEM
		I haven't added any of this to my .philconfig repo
	SOLUTION
		1) Move my .zshrc to .philconfig
		2) Add stuff in install.sh to do replace_with_link for that file
		3) Offer to install powerline fonts and ohmyzsh
	RESULT
		Not done yet :)

git-sh
	Not sure if I like it but it exists and it is obtained by cloning and
	make installing github:rtomayko/git-sh

	To add it to git setup, create tmp directory, then do make install with
	prefix equal to $HOME/.local/bin
