Functions on the newRepo side:
doBash()
{
	if [ -L "$HOME/.bashrc" ]
	then
		echo "\$HOME/.bashrc is already a symbolic link... aborting for bash"
		return
	fi
	mv bashrc, bashprofile, profile
	ln -s those three files
	echo "
		rm the three files in the home folder
		ln -s from the home folder to the files
	" >> $installDir/install.sh
}
... similar functions for all the groups of files
(!) If I run this twice, I'll get the lines twice in the install.sh,
(!) Still have to prevent from running the script twice, check if $HOME/file is link and if so don't do it.
